  <h3>Book 11</h3>
  <h4>The Lost Continent</h4>

  <hr />

  <h3>Everything is about to change.</h3>

  <h5>Blue the SilkWing is content. Life in his Hive is safe; he loves
    his family; he has enough to eat. And Pantala has been at peace for as
    long as he can remeber - SilkWings and HiveWings live and work together
    in harmony, and because they stay vigilant, no one has seen a dangerous
    LeafWing in years.</h5>

    <h5>Now that Blue's sister, Luna, is undergoing her Metamorohasis, Blue
      knows that thinks are going to change. Luna will have her wings and her silk,
      be assigned a partner and work order, and move to another Hive. A few days
      later, Blue's own wings and silk come in.</h5>

      <h5>But nothing could prepare Blue for what happens when Luna's wings
        start to grow. Suddenly his world is turned upside down, throwing him
        imto dangers he never knew existed. Pantala isn't as peaceful as it seems,
        and Blue isn't safe. Whether he's ready or not, it's time to adapt - and
        fight for his life.</h5>

        <h3>Book 12</h3>
        <h4>The Hive Queen</h4>

        <hr />

        <h3>The truth is a powerful weapon.</h3>

        <h5>Growing up in the hives, Cricket has always had a million questions.
          Why are trees forbidden, even in art? Why do her parents seem to hate her?
          And the biggest, most dangerous and secret question of all: Why is
          Cricket immune to Queen Wasp's powers? Whenever the queen takes control
          of all the HiveWings, speaking through their mouths and seeing through
          their eyes, Cricket has to hide, terrified of being discovered.</h5>

          <h5>Now she's hiding again, wanted for stealing the Book of Clearsight
            along with her new SilkWing friends, Blue and Swordtail, and the fierce
            LeafWing, Sundew. The fugitives need answers, and fast, in order to
            prevent a LeafWing attack. But Cricket has more questions then ever. How
            can she stay hidden and discover the queen's deadliest secret? And if
            she does succeed - can a powerless dragonet really do anything to topple
            a regime and stop a war?</h5>

            <h3>Book13</h3>
            <h4>The Poison Jungle</h4>

            <hr />

            <h3>Some secrets are deadly.</h3>

            <h5>It's no secret that Sundew wants to destroy the HiveWings. It's her
              life's mission to exact revenge on the tribe that tried to wipe out
              the LeafWings and ripped every tree from the surface of Pantala.</h5>

              <h5>Every tree, that is, except those in the wild and dangerous Poison
                Jungle, where the surviving LeafWings have been hinding since the war - and
                waiting for a dragon like Sundew, who is uniquely qualified to bring
                down the Hives.</h5>

                <h5>But secrets hide in the trees, too - some that Sundew is keeping, and
                  some that she's only beginning to discover. Now that a new war is upon them,
                  Sundew and her friends must unearth the darkest mystery in the jungle - even
                  if what they find has the power to destroy them all.</h5>

                  <h3>A wall can't protect them anymore ...</h3>

                  <h5>Snowfall didn't expect to be queen of the IceWings at such a
                    young age, but now that she is, she's going to be the best queen EVER.
                    All she has to do is keep her tribe within IceWing territory, where
                    it's safe - while keeping every other tribe out, where they belong.</h5>

                    <h5>It's a perfect and simple plan, backed up by the Ice Cliff wall
                      and every bit of IceWing magic Snowfall can gather. Perfect, that is, until
                      a storm of unidentified dragons flies in from the ocean, looking for asylum.</h5>

                      <h5>The foreigners are completely strange and, Snowfall is certain,
                        utterly untrustworthy. But as she escorts the miserable new
                        tribes out of her kingdom, the young queen is forced to reconsider
                        her plan. Maybe she can only keep her tribe safe ... if she's
                        willing to risk everything.</h5>
