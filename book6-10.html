  <h3> Book 6 </h3>

  <h4> Moon Rising</h4>
  <hr />

  <h3>Peace has come to Pyrrhia ... for now.</h3>

  <h5> The war between the tribes is finally over, and now
    the dragonets of the prophecy have a plan for lasting peace:
    Jade Mountain Academy, a school that will gather dragonets
    from all the tribes and teach them to live together, perhaps
    even as friends</h5>

    <h5> Moonwatcher isn't sure how she feels about school,
      however. Hidden in the rainforest for most her life, the young
      NightWing has an awful secret. She can read minds, and even
      see the future. Living in a cave with dozens of other dragons
      is noisy, exhauting - and dangerous.</h5>

      <h5> In just a few days, Moon finds herself overwhelmed
        by her secret powers, bombarded with strange thouoghts,
        including those of a mysterious dragon who might be a
        terrible enemy. And when someone starts attacking dragons
        within the academy, Moon has a choice to make: Stay hidden and
        safe? Or risk everything to save her new friends.</h5>

        <h3>Book 7</h3>
        <h4>Winter Turning</h4>

        <hr />

        <h3> Daring mission ... or deadly mistake</h3>

        <h5> Winter has been a disappointment to his royal family
          for his whole life. When his sister, Icicle, runs away
          from Jade Mountain Academy, fleeing terrible crimes and
          possibly planning to commit more, Winter knows that they
          both need a second chance to make things right - if
          only he can find her.</h5>

          <h5> Winter's new clawmates, Moon, Kinkajou, and Qibli,
            won't let him make this dangerous journey alone. They
            don't seem to understand that IceWings, the most
            superior of all dragon tribes, can fix their own problems.
            When their search leads the dragonets straight into
            Queen Scarlet's vicious talons, Winter is grateful to
            have some help. But even the bravest dragons can't follow
            him to the Ice Kingdom, where he'll have to face the
            greatest threat of all: his own family.</h5>

            <h3>Book 8</h3>
            <h4>Escaping Peril</h4>
            <hr />

            <h3>A question of loyalty ...</h3>

            <h5> Peril has always been loyal. First to Queen
              Scarlet, even when she used Peril's firescales
              to kill countless dragons in her violent SkyWing
              arena. Now, Peril is loyal to Clay, the only
              dragonet who has ever been her friend. So when
              Scarlet threatens Jade Mountain Acdemy and everything
              Clay cares about, Peril sets off to find her former
              queen, stop her, and save the day, no matter what it takes.</h5>

              <h5> But on the way, Peril is offered a chance at a
                completely new life, free of her firesclaes and all
                the pain they've brought her. All she has to do is
                decide where her loyalty really belongs ... and
                whether her own scales might actually be worth saving.</h5>

                <h3>Book 9</h3>
                <h4>Talons of Power</h4>

                <hr />

                <h3>For every villan, there is a hero ...</h3>

                <h5>Turtle isn't one of the heroes he reads about
                  in his stories. If he were, he'd use his animus powers
                  to help Pyrrhia - instead of keeping his abilities a
                  secret, even from his own sister. Now that Darkstalker,
                  the sinister and impossibly old dragon from Pyrrhia's
                  most notorious legends, has returned, Turtle
                  knows his own role is simple: hide. And stay hidden.</h5>

                  <h5> The other dragons at Jade Mountain Academy, on
                    the other hand, think Darkstalker is fascinating.
                    He charms everyone he meets, including Turle's
                    most skeptical friends. They all seem convinced
                    that the ancient dragon has changed.</h5>

                    <h5> Turtle isn't so sure. The more he watches
                      Darkstalker from the shadows, the more
                      Turtle knows that someone needs to stop the
                      powerful dragon. A real hero. But Turtle
                      is running out of time to find one, which means ...
                      he might have to try to save the day himself.</h5>

      <h3>Book 10</h3>
      <h4>Darkness of Dragons</h4>
      <hr />

      <h3>Time is running out.</h3>

      <h5> Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he
        knows he could stop him - if he had magic. With even
        a sliver of the ancient dragon's all-powerfull scroll,
        Qibli could rewrite history the right way: end war forever,
        make every dragon happy, perhaps even cast a very small
        spell so that everyone would like him ...</h5>

        <h5> Instead, as Darkstalker's dangerous influence spreads
          across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon
          in the seven tribes, Qibli can only grasp the small animus
          objects he's borrowed from Turtle. With some clever
          thinking, Qibli's talons finally hold the power to make
          a difference.</h5>

          <h5> But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli
            be the magical force Pyrrhia needs, or will he be the one
            to bring Jade Mountain - and his family, his friends,
            his whole world - crashing down?</h5>
