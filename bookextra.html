    <h3>In the shadows of wings ... humans fight for survival</h3>

    <h5>Ivy doesn't trust the Dragonslayer. He may be her father and the beloved
      ruler of Valor, but she knows he's hiding more than the treasure from the sand
      dragon he killed two decades ago.</h5>

        dead, and now he'll do whatever it takes to slay every one.</h5>

          tried to sacrifice her to the dragons. She only has one friend, a small, wonderful
          mountain dragon named Sky, and they don't need anyone else.</h5>

          <h5>In a world of dragons, the humans who scramble around underfoot are easy
            to overlook. But Ivy, Leaf, and Wren will each cross paths with dragons in
            ways that could shape the destiny of both speicies. Is a new future possible
            for all of them ... one in which humans can look to the skies with hope instead
            of fear.</h5>
